									<p>The all important water pump is the mechanism that pumps coolant through your engine.  Water pumps failure is common and you can expect to have to replace your water pump around the 100,000 mile mark, if not sooner.  Some water pumps are driven by a timing belt which makes it difficult to diagnose a bad bearing.  When your water pumps starts to go out, it's usually caused by the bearing for the pulley goes out or the gasket starts to leak.</p>
